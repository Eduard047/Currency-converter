# Currency Converter

This project is a simple currency converter written in JavaScript. It allows users to convert amounts between different currencies based on predefined exchange rates. The goal of this project is to demonstrate JavaScript code with type annotations to simulate a TypeScript-like approach without actually using TypeScript.
